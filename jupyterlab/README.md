This project uses [jupytext](https://jupytext.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) to maintain the jupyter notebooks.

To turn the python files into fully functioning jupyter notebooks, run 
jupytext --sync FILENAME
in the terminal

The python file should remain in sync with the jupyter notebook. Run jupytext.py to add a new jupyter notebook to the jupytext syncing.
